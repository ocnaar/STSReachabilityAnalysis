# STSReachabilityAnalysis
Compute over-approximations for the reachable sets of the state, input, 
and output of a three-link planar robot used to model the sit-to-stand  
(STS) movement of a Powered Lower Limb Orthosis (PLLO) in the presence of constant parameter uncertainty.                                                                

The main file is "ReachabilityAnalysis.m". The LTV Toolbox available 
at https://z.umn.edu/LTVTools and Matlab's Parallel Computing Toolbox 
are needed for running the script.               

The sensitivity-based approach is published in:
